1. 	fix recursive (function calls/any other recursive access) not being properly tokenized if not surrounded by parenthesis
	the issue lies in the grammar itself

	this does not work:
	var a = hello()();
	type b<T> = T[][];

	this does:
	var a = (hello())();
	(types don't support parenthesis so no working solution exists yet)

2. fix all recursive expressions being treated as function calls

3. probably add precedence to type cast expression
4. add enums
5. implement classes
6. add positions to each member of AST for better errors
7. implement array expressions (e.g. [1, 2, 3] or [])
8. fix array expressions ^ being interpreted as function calls
