1. 	fix recursive (function calls/any other recursive access) not being properly tokenized if not surrounded by parenthesis
	the issue lies in the grammar itself

	this does not work:
	var a = hello()();
	type b<T> = T[][];

	this does:
	var a = (hello())();
	(types don't support parenthesis so no working solution exists yet)

2. implement generics checking for function definition and calls
